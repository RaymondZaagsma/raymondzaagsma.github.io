# Liquit Context Filters

Liquit Context is a powerful feature that allows organizations to manage and configure their IT environments based on a range of different contexts. In this blog post, we'll explore what Liquit Context is, how it works, and why it's important for modern IT environments.

## What is Liquit Context?

Liquit Context is a feature of the Liquit Workspace solution that allows organizations to manage their IT environments based on a range of different contexts, such as user, device, location, and more. This means that IT administrators can tailor their IT environments to the specific needs of different users and devices, making it easier to manage and secure their IT infrastructure.

## How does Liquit Context work?

Liquit Context works by allowing IT administrators to define rules and policies that are based on different contexts. For example, an IT administrator might create a policy that specifies that certain applications are only available to users who are logged in from a specific location or device. This policy could then be automatically applied to all users who meet the specified context criteria, ensuring that the IT environment is configured correctly for each user.

Liquit Context also allows for real-time updating of policies based on changing contexts. For example, if a user changes devices, their policy will be updated to reflect the new device, ensuring that their IT environment remains consistent and secure.

## Why is Liquit Context important?

Liquit Context is important for modern IT environments because it allows IT administrators to manage and configure their IT environments in a way that is tailored to the specific needs of different users and devices. This can help to improve security and reduce the risk of data breaches by ensuring that users only have access to the applications and data that they need to perform their jobs.

Liquit Context also helps to improve productivity by ensuring that users have access to the applications and data that they need, when and where they need it. This can help to reduce the amount of time that users spend looking for the resources they need, and can help to improve collaboration and communication within teams.
