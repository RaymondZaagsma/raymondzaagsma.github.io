# MDT Pause Task Sequence

Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) is a popular tool used by IT professionals to automate the deployment of Windows operating systems and applications. One of the key features of MDT is the ability to pause a task sequence, which can be useful for troubleshooting or making manual changes during the deployment process. In this blog post, we'll explore how to pause a task sequence in MDT.

## What is a Task Sequence in MDT?

A task sequence in MDT is a set of instructions that define the steps involved in deploying Windows to a device. It includes the necessary configuration settings, applications, drivers, and scripts to automate the deployment process. A task sequence can be customized to suit the needs of a specific deployment, making it a powerful tool for IT professionals.

## What is Pausing a Task Sequence?

Pausing a task sequence in MDT is the process of temporarily stopping the deployment process to allow for troubleshooting or manual intervention. This can be useful when there is an error or issue that needs to be addressed before continuing with the deployment process.

How to Pause a Task Sequence in MDT

To pause a task sequence in MDT, follow these steps:

1. Open the MDT Deployment Workbench and navigate to the task sequence you want to pause.

2. Right-click on the task sequence and select Properties.

4. Choose General, and then select Run Command Line.

5. In the Command line field, type the following command: cmd.exe /c echo "Pause Task Sequence for Troubleshooting" >> Pause.txt

6. Give the step a descriptive name, such as "Pause Task Sequence for Troubleshooting."

7. Click on the Task Sequence tab and then click on the Add button.

8. Choose General, and then select Run Command Line.

9. In the Command line field, type the following command: cmd.exe /c notepad.exe Pause.txt

7. Click OK to save the step, and then click OK again to save the task sequence properties.

Now, when the task sequence is deployed, it will pause at the step you added. This will allow you to troubleshoot any issues or make manual changes before continuing with the deployment process.

## Conclusion

Pausing a task sequence in MDT is a simple process that can be useful for troubleshooting or making manual changes during the deployment process.  
By following the steps outlined above, IT professionals can pause a task sequence in MDT and ensure a successful deployment.
